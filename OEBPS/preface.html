<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This book has been compiled as part of a reformed school
curriculum. The principles of this reform cannot be discussed
here; it must be enough to say, that Greek finds a place, not
at the beginning, but towards the end of the school course,
being begun in the Fourth Form (average age 14½ to 15). At
this stage the boy's mind is more mature, and having been
carefully trained by means of French and Latin, he is able to
make rapid progress. Two terms (or less) are enough to work
through this book; and in the third term an easy author may
be begun, the grammar being revised along with the author.
For the convenience of teachers, a Companion Reader has
been compiled, which includes a number of stories, each complete
in itself.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that the book may be found suitable for
those who begin Greek earlier, but their progress will of course
be slower the earlier they begin.</p>

<p>As regards the method of use, I assume that the master
will do as much as possible <i>viva voce</i>. Specimens of this
method are given here and there, but it is not intended that
they be kept to slavishly: they are specimens only. The
essence of any such method is, that it be fresh and spontaneous;
and the master must be ready to use his material in conversation
on the spur of the moment. But conversation is not meant to
take the place of construing and writing. All three must go on <span id="piv"/>
side by side: construing, not to teach English (which is taught
separately), but to make sure that the meaning of the Greek is
understood; writing, to give accuracy, and to fix new facts in
the mind; conversation, as a means of practice. The place
of conversation is to make the boys quick; to give them
continued drill in using their material with slight but definite
changes (<i>I</i> for <i>you</i>, <i>am</i> for <i>are</i>, etc.); and, not least, to bring
the Greek into close connection with their lives. We use
a great deal of conversation which is not hinted at here,
carrying on much of the business of the class-room in Greek.</p>

<p>There are a few novelties in the arrangement which will, I
hope, prove to be useful. With the very alphabet we are able
to begin with a piece of genuine Greek literature, quotation
from Kallias's <i>Grammatike Theoria</i> (Athenaeus, p. 454): for
this idea I have to thank Prof. J.Ε.B. Mayor, who has taken
the liveliest interest in our experiment. I have used one or
two liberties with the text, which I hope the author's ghost will
forgive, in consideration of the wide advertisement I have given
to his work. The declensions are begun with the Adjective,
which, being like the Latin <i>bonus</i>, is easily remembered,
and thus the chief forms of two declensions are mastered
at once. Similarly, the participle ὤν gives the type for a large
number of adjectival and nominal forms. For the rest, I have
been guided by expediency, placing first the forms which are
most wanted. A scientific order is not necessary in learning;
once learnt, the matter can easily be revised in a scientific
order by aid of the <a href="compendium.html">Compendium (p. 89)</a>. Those who have
not tried may think that too much is given in each exercise,
but this will not be found to be true. At 14 or 15 a boy who
has learnt Latin grammar thoroughly can get over Greek at a
great pace. It is not intended that a whole exercise should
be always done at each lesson; each master must decide for <span id="pv"/>
himself how much he can get through. It is easy to divide
them.</p>

<p>The book was first used in manuscript for a year; then
printed and used for a year in proof; finally, with many alterations
which use suggested, it was reprinted and used for a
third year. I think, therefore, that I may safely call it a
practical book. My thanks are due to my friend and fellow-worker,
Mr. W.H.S. Jones, for his criticisms and suggestions,
most of which are embodied in it. I thank also the publisher
most sincerely for allowing me to keep the book in type so
long.</p>

<p>The reading extracts are all taken from Greek authors; it
may be left as a pleasant exercise for those who use the book,
to find out where they come from. A certain amount of
compression or alteration has sometimes been necessary, and
a few un-Attic constructions and words have been changed,
for which changes I make no apology. The conversations are
invented.</p>

<p>I am confident that a fair trial of the method assumed in
this book, combined, of course, with a reorganised curriculum,
will show that those who attack the study of Greek are under
a misapprehension. I am quite ready to admit that classical
education, as it is understood in this country, is a failure.
There are, indeed, some boys whom nothing can spoil; there
are many clever boys who learn a great deal, and who at 19
are chock-full of information. These do not suffer so much
as might be expected. But as an education it is a failure;
because it does not teach even these clever boys to use their
intelligence as they could be taught to do, and because it
makes, the average boy dull, unintelligent, and a hater of all
intellectual exercise. It does not follow, however, that the
failure is due to the subject. That the adversary may not twist <span id="pvi"/>
my words to suit his own purpose, I add, that the modern substitutes
for classics do not seem to me to be any better: all our
schools are spoilt by the same faults of cram, early specialising,
and mercenary aims. Greek, however, can be learnt with
profit and enjoyment by the average boy, so that in less than a
year he can read the Apology of Socrates; and all that is paid
for that result is one lesson of three-quarters of an hour a day.
That is not a heavy price to pay for the key to the finest
instrument of human speech, and it does not involve neglecting
anything. On the contrary: along with it the boy may
thoroughly study his own tongue, may learn to use it and to
understand and enjoy English literature, may win a serviceable
knowledge of French and Latin, may have the usual drill in
mathematics, and may do a very fair amount of natural science.</p>
