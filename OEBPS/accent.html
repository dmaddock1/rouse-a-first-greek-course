<h2>ACCENT</h2>

<p>1. Must be on one of the last three syllables.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash; -οι -αι are counted as short for this purpose, except
Opt. mood.</p>

<p>2. If the last syllable is long, must be on one of the last two.</p>

<p>3. In Nouns, Adj., and Part., it remains on the same syllabic
as in Nom., provided this does not break Rule 2.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But&mdash;</p>

<p>(a) Monosyllables of the 3rd declension, accent final
in Gen. and Dat.</p>

<p>(b) Gen. Pl. of 1st declension has the circumflex on
the last.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4. In Verbs, it goes back as far as the general rules (1 and 2)
allow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But&mdash;</p>

<p>(a) Strong or 2nd Aor. accents last in Part. and Inf.
Act.</p>

<p>(b) All Aorists Passive accent last in Part., last but
one in Inf.</p>

<p>(c) Perf. Pass, accents last but one in Part. and Inf.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>5. (a) Enclitics throw back an acute on the preceding word,
unless that word has the acute on its last syllable but
one, or the circumflex on its last.</p>

<p>(b) Disyllabic enclitics take acute on their last syllable if
the preceding word has the acute on its last but one.</p>
