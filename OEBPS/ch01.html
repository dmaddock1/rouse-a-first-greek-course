<span id="p2"/>

<p><span class="sc">Notes on Pronunciation</span>.&mdash;γ before γ, κ, ξ is sounded <i>ng</i>.</p>

<p>The aspirates θ, φ, χ were pronounced as two distinct sounds combined:
as in <i>anthill, uphold, lackhose</i>. θ is still so pronounced in the
island of Astypalaea. They may, however, be pronounced like the English
<i>th, f, ch,</i> if the true sounds are found to be too difficult. In groups of
consonants where the aspiration could not well be pronounced, it was
probably sounded before the following vowel (as in modern Bengalee):
thus ἄνθρωπος = ἄντρὡπος.</p>

<p>υ (=Fr. <i>u</i>) should not be sounded oo, or it is confused with ου.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Quantity</span> must be strictly observed. The voice should be prolonged
on a long vowel twice as long as on a short vowel (like crotchet and
quaver). This should be carefully practised while time is beaten as in
music. This has nothing to do with accent, or with stress.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Double Consonants</span> are pronounced by dwelling upon the sound: as
in English <i>tub-boat, black-cat, midday, full-liberty, home-made, ten-nights,
stop-press, fur-rug, this-sort, that-time</i>.</p>

<p>The so-called improper diphthongs, in which a long ᾱ η ω is
followed by ι, were written αι ηι ωι, and pronounced as written.
In modern books they are generally written ᾳ ῃ ῳ, with ‘iota
subscript,’ and pronounced ᾱ η ω simply.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Breathings</span>.&mdash;A vowel at the beginning of a word has the
‘rough breathing’ if aspirated, the ‘smooth breathing’ if not.
The rough breathing was originally represented by Η (afterwards
used as a vowel), but in quick writing-hand this came to be
written like a comma reversed (῾) over the vowel; the smooth
breathing was then written (᾿). Thus ἄλφα ‘alpha,’ ὅς ‘hǒs.’</p>

<p>The rough breathing is always written over initial ρ: as ῥῶ.
The stops are (,) comma, (·) colon, (.) full stop, (;) question mark.</p>

<span id="p3"/>

<p>The consonants are thus classified (the table should be
learnt by heart):&mdash;</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;There are two membranes in the throat called vocal
cords. If these are tightened when the air comes up from the
lungs, the sound is called Voiced, if they are slack it is called
Breathed. When tightened the cords can be felt to vibrate by
placing a finger upon the throat.</p>

<p id="p3accent"><span class="sc">Accent</span>.&mdash;Every Greek word, except a few, has an accent,
which originally marked the raising of the tone of voice, not
stress as in English. It is possible with careful practice from
the first, to raise the tone on these syllables (as little stress as
possible being used) and to observe quantity at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="sc">General Rule</span>.&mdash;The acute accent (´) must fall on one of the
last three syllables. If the last have a long vowel, on one of
the last two. On final syllables, except last in a sentence, the
acute accent is written as grave (`).</p>

<p>The circumflex (῀) denotes a raising and lowering of tone on
one vowel, as in certain English when the expression of surprise
is intended (<i>nô!</i>). It must fall on one of the last two syllables,
and it cannot stand before a long vowel or diphthong. It
can only stand on a long vowel or diphthong, as it implies
contraction.</p>

<p>A few words are only used in combination with others
which go before them. These have no accent, and are called
enclitics. They generally throw their accent back upon the
last syllable of the word before.</p>

<p>A few other words, standing first in a phrase, have no accent;
these are called proclitics (as εἰ ‘if,’ εἰς ‘into,’ ἐν ‘in’).</p>

<span id="p4"/>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Interrogatives always have the accent.
Indefinites are enclitic, and generally have none.</p>
